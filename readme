Follow these steps to build the kgui library

1) For building using the GNU compiler launch a shell ( use MSYS/Mingw for windows )

There is also a visual studio solution called "kgui" that you can comnpile with visual studio.
Note: ffmpeg cannot be compiled with visual studio and must be compiled with MSYS/Mingw

2) ./configure

This is for configuring the other libraries that kgui uses like zlib, jpeg, freetype, ffmpeg

3) make other

This builds all the other libraries 

4) make

This builds kgui and once finished then the kgui library is ready to be linked with your application


5) There are also small sample programs in the samples directory, the Visual Studio solution will
 automatically make them, for the GUI compiler just go into each directory and type 'make'
